Cosmic Intruders Project History!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intro:

This project was made as a test for Miniclip Web Client Developer vacancy by
the end of 2017. Almost 2 years later I decided to revisit it (and ~all~ almost
all of my other projects) and clean things up and release again.

Fortunately I passed the test and enter Miniclip! I came to Portugal, where
I'm living right now, and I still work for Miniclip to the present day.

I'm really, really fond of this project since Space Invaders was one of my
three first games that I played in life.

Dad got a Brazilian Atari-Clone  with Pac-Man, Enduro and Space Invaders
to me and my brother. I was very young, but I still have some glimpses of
playing this game.

Of course I can not stress enough that was a Space Invaders the enabled me
to came to Europe and live the best moments of my life so far.

So, just to let clear... I love this project and I really wanted to say thanks
for life to give me this opportunity, to Miniclip for all this time that I'm
with them and especially to my Solange Marques Ribeiro, my mother, that was
extremely supportive to me during the process of development of the project.


Technical Stuff:

The project works quite well, it's MUCH MORE complex that it's needed to be.
Back then I had a different mindset about how organize stuff and how to
program things.

Today I KNOW that any moron can handle complexity quite well, but only a genius
can make simple things simple. While I'm not proud of my code anymore I'll not
change anything that not absolutely necessary to be changed to the project
works correctly. I want this to be the way it was... there's no point to try
to re-write history, but there's a point to learn with past mistakes and
improve for the future.

So now I'm aware of all the complexity, all the burden and all the shit that
I developed in past, this is actually good since I can compare me as today,
with myself in the past and check how I'm evolving...

PS: I'm changing the license headers for all the files with updated information.

End:

That's all... I'm quite happy here in Portugal, I'm quite happy working for
Miniclip and I'm quite happy to everything that life presented to me.

Thanks everyone that help me in any form (even the folks in coffee shops with
their smiles) I'm what I'm partly because of everyone of you.

I'm glad for everything...

Let's make more games ;D
