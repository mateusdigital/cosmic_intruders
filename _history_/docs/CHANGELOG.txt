v1.0.2 - Nov 19, 2017.

[CHANGE]
    - Improve the play page a little. So now it's more pretty!
      Yep, I know, my html+css skills are pretty limited ;D

    - Update the Cooper.
      It had a bug on TextureAtlas load, that was not informing that
      the asset wasn't found.

[REMOVE]
    - page.css.
      It isn't needed at all for now. All the css stuff is inline on the
      index.html page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.1 - Nov 18, 2017.

[ADD]
    - Add the docs files.

    - Add the update_version.sh script.
      Now we can update the version of the game easily. It must be run every
      new release to keep the source files with the git tags.

    - Add the Version.h.
      So now the source files can "know" which version the project has.

[CHANGE]
    - Update the Cooper submodule.
      It had a bug on TextEntity.

    - main.cpp:
      Pass the GameUtils::kWindowCaption to the Graphics::Init function,
      so the window title will be correct everytime.

    - GameUtils.h:
      Change it from a "class-like" namespace to a struct to make easier
      to update the kWindowCaption without too much recompilation.
